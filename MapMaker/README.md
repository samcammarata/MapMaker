# MapMaker

Sophia-edit2 notes:
Changed Map text box to a Domain Up Down since I feel like maybe it could work better, but if you disagree then I understand and it's an easy change. So when you create a new map, it should add in a Map 2 option. Not entirely sure how to go about clearing the previous info though.

Added another possible way to save files. Unsure of which would work better since I can't test it without the array.

Took info Prof. Kalb put in and began expanding it to cover all four players' icons, locations, etc.

Thought about Prof. Kalb's advice on some of the buttons. Fixed the save button; it now writes to a textfile all of the information. Clear and Create New work better now as well.
