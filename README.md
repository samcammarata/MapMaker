# MapMaker

Sophia-edit2 notes:
Changed Map text box to a Domain Up Down since I feel like maybe it could work better, but if you disagree then I understand and it's an easy change. So when you create a new map, it should add in a Map 2 option. Not entirely sure how to go about clearing the previous info though.

Added another possible way to save files. Unsure of which would work better since I can't test it without the array.
